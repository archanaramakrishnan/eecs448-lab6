POSSIBLE BUG 1: enqueue
enqueue is adding to the front instead of the back
elements are getting added
but they are being added to the front instead of m_back
this is evident when a peekfront is performed and it returns the latest element that was inserted, instead of the very first element

POSSIBLE BUG 2: peekFront
peekFront does not return the same value each time an element is enqueued because enqueue is buggy and adds to the front instead of the m_back

POSSIBLE BUG 3: dequeue
dequeue removes in order of insertion instead of in first in first out (FIFO) manner because enqueue adds to the front

MEMORY LEAKS:
I had 10 memory leak and they were all being caused when I called enqueue() in my test functions
The destructor is hence not corrctly functional because it does not delete a pointer that is create in enqueue
