POSSIBLE BUG: enqueue is adding to the front instead of the back
elements are getting added, but they are being added to the front instead of back. This is evident when a peekfront is performed is performed and it returns the latest element that was inserted, instead of the very first element.

peekFront does not return the same value each time an element is enqueued because enqueue is buggy
